exploit:

Remote Code Execution via session persistence CVE-2020-9484

* an attacker is able to control the contents and name of a file on the server; and
* the server is configured to use the PersistenceManager with a FileStore; and
* the PersistenceManager is configured with sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter="null" (the default unless a SecurityManager is used) or a sufficiently lax filter to allow the attacker provided object to be deserialized; and
* the attacker knows the relative file path from the storage location used by FileStore to the file the attacker has control over;

    using a specifically crafted request, the attacker will be able to trigger remote code execution via deserialization of the file under their control
