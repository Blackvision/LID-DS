# LID-DS
The LID-DS package presents a lightweight framework for simulating attack/non-attack scenarios. This package handles the timing of events like:
* Container Initialization
* Starting Normal Behaviour
* Warmup Phase
* Recording via Sysdig
* Executing the exploit dependend on the fact if the scenario is an attack scenario or not

LID-DS manages docker containers on which the scenarios are modeled. The result of such a simulation should be a pcap file expressing the system calls executed by the docker container during the scenario.
